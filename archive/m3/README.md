# Milestone 3

Due to 7/2 (Wed)

## Deliverables

**Demo and lessons learned**

For the final milestone, the team will demo the completed system, and present the lessons learned.

## Check list

For the final deliverable there will be both a team presentation and a demonstration of the final system.

### Team presentation

The presentation should cover:

- Quality attribute requirements for the system.
  - Present evidence that the performance approach is sound.
  - Present evidence that the structural design supports the addition of new features.
  - Present evidence through verification test data that the system achieves active measures to manage loss of communication.
  - Present evidence how the developer/maintainer can easily replace map data in the user interface.
  - Present evidence of good code quality (e.g., low defect numbers)
- Architecture description showing architecture views and highlighting key architectural approaches adopted and their rationale.
- Description and results of experiments and architecture evaluation activities. 
- Lessons learned (what went right, what went wrong, what would you have done differently).

The presentation duration is 20 minutes (subject to change). That is not enough time for an extensive coverage of the topics listed above. Therefore, you should select one or a few key points in each topic to talk about.

### Demonstration (also known as 'Demo')

There will be a live demo of the system. Guidelines and evaluation criteria:

- Your Raspberry Pi Flight Tracker will be placed outside of the room near a window.
- The student team inside the classroom connects to the Raspberry Pi Flight Tracker through the remote user interface.

- The student team connects to the ADSBHub.org data.

- The student team demonstrates basic functionality

  - Using each of the modes

  - Displaying map data

  - Displaying flight information

- The student team demonstrates the added features:

  - Safety and Deviation Analysis

  - Aircraft and Route Metadata

  - Time Series Analysis

- The student team demonstrates how system meets the quality requirements

- The student team demonstrates upgrades to enhance the user experience with the remote user interface

- Maximum time limit for the demonstration will be 20 minutes.

- Additional guidance will be provided 1-2 weeks from the scheduled demonstration date.
