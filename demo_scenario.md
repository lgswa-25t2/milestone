## 1. App Launch & Aircraft Loading 

- Launch the IFTA application
- Confirm that real-time aircraft are displayed
- Zoomed-out view: Aggregation rendering (clustered aircraft groups)

---

## 2. Zoom In & Select Aircraft

- Confirm that real-time updates reflect immediately

---

## 4. Route Lookup & Time-to-Go Line

- Click "Route Lookup" → display airway route
- Highlight time-to-go lines with altitude-based color coding

---

## 5. Safety Features Demo --- 

- Click aircraft near airport (1nm or 5nm zone)
- System triggers “Collision Warning” or “Deviation Detected” ---- HOW???
- Show View filter for safety zones ---- HOW???

---

## 6. Switch to Live Map 

- Click “Live Map” button
- Switch to OpenStreetMap view
