# milestone

This is a repository for architecture documents of team 2.

The folder ***latest*** is the most recent documents. Each milestone (m1, m2, m3) point copies the contents of the ***latest*** folder at that point to the ***m1***, ***m2***, ***m3*** folders in ***archive*** and creates a tag.

Please check the [latest](./latest) folder for the latest information.
