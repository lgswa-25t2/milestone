## Quality Attributes Requirements

Derived from Section. *System and Software Quality Attributes* & Section. *Demo Scoring* in project description. Each item can be added or changed and can be specified through discussion with sponsor.

In order to prioritize, ***I*** and ***R*** scores were given according to the following criteria.

- ***I*** (Business importance) - The score assigned in the demo scoring was H if it was 30 points, M if it was 20 points, and L if it was 10 points or less.
- ***R*** (Technical Risk) - Since all members are developers, we wrote subjectively based on our own development experience.

- Impact (I): Level of damage if the risk occurs

### Technical Risk Assessment

| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TR_1 | System may not be updated normally due to large volume of aircraft data is received by the ADS-B server in a short period of time. | H    | H    | consider Manage sampling rate to adjust the volume of aircraft data. | [Exp 1](./experiments/exp01-aircraft-number.md) , [Exp 2](./experiments/exp02-ingestion-rate.md) |
| TR_2 | We need to apply multi-thread in program, but the VCL framework does not support multi thread. If background threads directly access or modify UI components, it may result in application instability, race conditions, or unexpected crashes. | M    | L    | Separate business logic from UI logic, and run the UI thread and the data processing thread independently. | [Exp 7](./experiments/exp07-multi-thread.md)                 |
| TR_3 | The Raspberry Pi can fail for various reasons (e.g. crash, out of memory), and it is unclear whether it provides the cause of failure depending on the situation. | H    | L    | Modify the Raspberry Pi to report its status information.    | [Exp 6](./experiments/exp06-pi-operation.md)                 |
| TR_4 | UI, network, and data processing are tightly coupled, making it unclear where to insert the deviation detection logic. | H    | H    | Separation of UI, network, and data processing components.   | Planned draw diagrams                                        |

### Non-technical Risk Assessment

Because there is no part that is linked to other parts of the documents, items didn't have an unnecessary ID.

| Some requirement documents lack clarity, making analysis difficult. Clarification is only possible through assumptions or direct contact with the project sponsor. unclear requirements can lead to rework, misalignment, and missed goals. | Ambiguous documents and vague requirements                   | H    | H    | Clarify ambiguous requirements by maintaining continuous, question-and-answer-based communication with Solvelt throughout the project lifecycle.Seek solutions via regular meetings with mentors and expedite requirement confirmation by suggesting common assumptions. |
| Communication within the team is limited to English due to diverse nationalities. | Different native languages                                   | H    | H    | Leverage visual collaboration tools such as Miro, along with AI-powered translation tools, to facilitate effective communication across language barriers. |
| Communication is limited to Solvelt and email, resulting in long delays in receiving responses. | Lack of proper decision-making channels                      | M    | H    | Proactively reach out to mentors and maintain regular contact with Solvelt |
| LG company PC security tools hinder development and test environment setup. | Network blocks and data transfer restrictions by security software | M    | M    | Use alternative devices (e.g., mobile), request exception handling from IT security team |
| The project duration is limited to approximately 4 weeks, with additional assignments affecting overall work efforts. | Short project timeline and parallel other tasks(Assignment, Quiz). | H    | H    | Focus on essential features, utilize planning tools and AI assistance for efficiency. |

## Potential Quality Attribute Trade-offs

Based on the defined Quality Attributes (QAs), the following trade-offs may arise due to conflicting architectural goals:

#### 1. Performance vs. Modifiability / Extensibility

*QAs Involved*

- `QA_001`: *UI responds immediately to user interaction* (Performance)
- `QA_003 / 004 / 005`: *Ease of adding new features such as deviation detection, unregistered aircraft identification, and new map providers* (Extensibility / Modifiability)

*Potential Conflict*

- Designing for modularity and flexibility often introduces layers of abstraction or interface boundaries, which can lead to increased data processing overhead and reduced performance.
- To improve performance, techniques such as caching, multithreading, and data prefetching can be applied. However, these techniques often introduce **state** into the system or cause **race conditions**, making the system harder to understand and modify.

*Decision*

- In case of conflict between performance and extensibility, we prioritized performance for core real-time features while isolating extension modules to minimize impact.

#### 2. Performance vs. Resiliency

*QAs Involved*

- `QA_001` (Performance)
- `QA_002`: *Detects and recovers from failure conditions* (Resiliency)

*Potential Conflict*

- Adding frequent monitoring (e.g., heartbeat checks, retry loops) can introduce extra system load, potentially impacting real-time responsiveness.
- Balancing proactive failure detection with minimal overhead is essential.

*Decision*

- We prioritized performance for time-critical UI interactions, while applying lightweight monitoring mechanisms to minimize overhead.

#### Summary Table

| QA 1        | QA 2          | Reason for Trade-off                                         |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Performance | Modifiability | Modular structure increases overhead; tight coupling boosts speed |
| Performance | Resiliency    | Monitoring and recovery add load and complexity              |
