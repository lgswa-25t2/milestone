# Milestone 1

Due to 6/10 (Tue)

## Deliverables

**Requirements, project plan, plan for experimentation, and risks**

For the first milestone the team will turn in the prioritized architectural drivers, any draft design decisions they are considering, the technical risks identified, and the experimentation plans (or any results already achieved).

## Check list

The submission can be informal documents describing the team’s current understanding of the items listed below. Team mentors will be meeting with the teams to ask follow up questions.

### Project Plan

- The plan should describe the division of roles, the specific tasks planned, and the associated milestones.
- The tasks should reflect construction based on the overall architecture.
- The tasks should also reflect planned technical experiments.

### Architectural Drivers

- Are the quality attribute requirements “actionable”? In other words, are they expressed in such a way that the team will be able to determine if a given design supports these drivers or not?
- Do the drivers seem to relate to the overall objectives of the project?
- Are the measures clearly derived from the overall goals of the project?
- Are the functional requirements understood?
- Is there a mechanism for prioritizing the requirements?

### Risk Assessment/Planned Experiments

- What are the technical and non-technical risks? How do you assess each risk with respect to probability and impact in a High-Medium-Low scale?
- Are the open questions/issues clearly related to things that will affect the outcome of the project?
- Have there been any actions identified to address the open questions/issues?
- Are the technical experiments concretely articulated?
- Is it clear what question/issue is being addressed by the experiments?
- Will it be clear when the experiments are complete?

### Architectural Approaches

- What is the overview-level description of the architecture?
- What are the main architectural approaches (tactics, patterns, design strategies) in your solution?
- Is the proposed design sound enough to guide construction?
- Are the architectural approaches clearly related to the drivers (will they likely impact the properties of interest)?
- Can you explain how well the architectural drivers are supported by the architecture?
