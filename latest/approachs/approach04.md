# **Approach 4: Applying Architecture pattern for Modular Aircraft Identification**

There are general design patterns for modularity and extensibility.

* **Strategy Pattern**

  * Encapsulates each identification method (e.g., unregistered, military, VIP) as interchangeable strategy objects.

* **Plugin Registry**

  * Supports dynamic loading and registration of identification strategies at runtime.

* **Observer Pattern**

  * Notifies decoupled observers (e.g., UI alerts, logs) when identification events occur.

* **Chain of Responsibility**

  * Processes identification logic in sequence, handing off unhandled data to the next module.

## **Decision**

We can't decide yet.

## **Rationale**

TBD

## **Status**

[***Proposed*** | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## **Consequences**

### **Positive**

* **Extensibility**: New strategies can be added or updated independently.
* **Testability**: Strategies are isolated and easy to unit test.
* **Configurability**: Admins can enable/disable modules via configuration files or UI.
* **Performance**: Only active strategies consume runtime resources.
* **Maintainability**: Separation between core logic and identification logic simplifies evolution.

### **Negative**

* **Complexity**: Requires an abstraction layer and runtime module management.
* **Memory Overhead**: Plugin registration and multiple strategy objects consume additional memory.
* **Debugging Difficulty**: Distributed logic may increase complexity during troubleshooting.
* **Integration Risk**: Changes in the strategy interface can break compatibility with existing plugins.
