# Approach 2: Detecting failure conditions
There are general tactics for performance.
- Fault detection
  - Heartbeat - Heatbeat from Rasp.PI every 500ms(TBD)
- Fault notification
  - User Feedback Mechanism - Show status banner or message box (e.g. Disconnected PI)

## Decision 
We can't decide yet. In order to make a decision, it is necessary to determine the current performance, check whether it is a applied, and check the improvement after applying the strategy.

## Rationale 
TBD

## Status
[***Proposed*** | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Consequences
Resulting context will be described.
