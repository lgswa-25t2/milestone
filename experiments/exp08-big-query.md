# Experiment 8: TBD - about BigQuery

## Results and recommendations

To be written upon completion of the experiment.

## Objective



## Status

\[***Planned*** | In progress | Suspended | Canceled | Concluded]

## Expected outcomes



## Resources required

* **Hardware**:

  * Raspberry Pi 5
  * Wi-Fi-enabled test environment
  * Removable external antenna (if used)
  * Power supply with switch (for simulating lock-up or forced reset)

* **Software**:

  * Device-side agent expected to report error status or send heartbeat
  * Network tools for ping/connection monitoring (e.g., `ping`, `fping`, custom watchdog)

* **Personnel**: 2 people Ã— 5 hours

  * (1 for physical and network testing, 1 for log capture and analysis)

## Experiment description

### 1. Setup



### 2. Test Scenarios



  * Whether heartbeat stops
  * If our system detects this via timeout or ping failure
  * Whether any residual logs are sent on reboot



### 3. Conclusion and Review



## Duration
