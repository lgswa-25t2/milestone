# Milestone 2

Due to  6/23 (Mon)

## Deliverables

**Experimentation results, design, plan for construction**

The team will turn in the results of experiments conducted, a design description with different architecture views, and the plan for construction.

## Check list

Again, the submission can be informal documents describing the teamâ€™s current understanding of the items listed below. The mentors will be meeting with the teams to ask follow up questions.

### Project Plan

- How has the plan changed?

- Has the team been actively assessing risk and updating the plan accordingly?

- Does the team have a plan for any remaining significant issues/risks?

- Does the team have a reasonable construction plan?

### Experiments/Results

- What experiments have been conducted?
- Have the results of the experiments addressed the open questions/issues?

- What experiments remain?

- Are the experiments focused on issues relevant to the overall goals of the system?

### Architecture

- What is the architecture in terms of the organization of code units and their dependencies? (The team shall create at least one module view of the architecture.)
- What is the architecture in terms of components and connectors (runtime perspective)? (The team shall create at least one runtime/C&C view of the architecture.)
- What is the architecture in terms of the supporting infrastructure (deployment perspective)? (The team shall create a deployment view that shows high-level component allocation to hardware elements and communication channels.)

- Have the experiments led to a refinement of the architecture?

- Does the team understand the architectural approaches they selected and respective tradeoffs?

- Do the architectural approaches align with the goals of the system?
- Are there significant concerns that have not been addressed?
- Has the architecture been evaluated?
